# InternetUsageMonitor

## Description

**InternetUsageMonitor** is an add-on for the NVDA screen reader that allows users to monitor their internet connection usage in terms of data sent and received. This tool is particularly useful for individuals who need to keep track of their data consumption over time, whether for bandwidth management or simply out of personal curiosity.

## How It Works

Once activated, **InternetUsageMonitor** begins tracking the user's internet connection data usage. Tracking is started or stopped through a specific keyboard shortcut (`Alt + NVDA + W`) customizable in input gestures under the InternetUsageMonitor category.

When monitoring starts, the add-on records the current time and the amount of data sent and received at that moment. Upon stopping the monitoring, it calculates the difference in time and data to determine the total megabytes used during the monitoring session, and verbalizes this information to the user via NVDA.
